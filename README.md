# For Contributors

When updating the code remember the following points:

1. Extensively test the program before pushing
2. If you added a new feature, update `docs.md` with a desciption of the statement and give an example of it's usage
3. Update `test.oc` if a new feature has been added
4. Update the changelog
5. Change the version number if the feature was large enough

TODO:
- Move to a transpiler (OrthoC -> C binary output) if im feeling adventerous
- Implementation of conditional statements (if/else)
- User input
- Basic file handling
- Better error handling
